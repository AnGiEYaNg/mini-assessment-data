# Review Week Mini-Assessment 1

## Data Structures & Sorting Algorithms

### Fork the Repo

Navigate to [this repo]() and fork it to your own Github account. Then `git clone` your forked repo to your local machine.

### Running the Specs

The Test'Em Jasmine spec runner must be installed on your system

```
npm install -g testem
```

Execute the tests by running `testem` from one of the two assessment folders (`data/` or `sort/`). When you complete one suite, work on the other. You may work on either suite first.

### Submitting your Code

When you have completed both suites, push your final version back up to your Github fork (not to the original upstream source). Then zip your project directory and email it to the [Fullstack instructors](instructors@fullstackacademy.com).
